## üíª Technical Arsenal (Because Bills Don't Pay Themselves)

### Languages I've Been Forced to Learn:
- C/C++ (For when I hate myself extra)
- C# (Microsoft's way of saying "almost Java")
- Java (Verbose punishment for past sins)
- Python (The one language I actually tolerate)
- Kotlin (Java, but make it fancy)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (The chaotic evil of languages)
- PHP (We don't talk about why I know this)
- Rust (For when regular pain isn't enough)
- Go (At least it's fast)
- Ruby (Because apparently elegance matters)
- Swift (Apple made me do it)
- Scala (Java's sophisticated cousin)

### Frameworks I'm Trapped In:
- Spring/Spring Boot (Java's life support)
- Laravel (PHP's redemption arc)
- React/Next.js (Because DOM manipulation is too simple)
- Angular (For when I need more structure in my suffering)
- Vue.js (The framework that occasionally sparks joy)
- Django (Python's way of being serious)
- Flutter (Cross-platform, cross-patience)
- Express.js (Node's saving grace)
- ASP.NET (Corporate chains)
- Ruby on Rails (Magic that occasionally backfires)
- Svelte (The new kid I'm forced to befriend)

## üî® Creator of [Azeng Lang](https://github.com/JiilanTj/AzengLang)
An Indonesian-based interpreter programming language built with C, because apparently creating new languages is what happens when existing ones drive you to the edge.

## ‚è≥ Professional Journey
Coding since 2016. Not by choice, but here we are. 

## üì± Current Chains
Currently deepening my Stockholm syndrome with Kotlin and Swift for mobile development.
